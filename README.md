Food Delivery Time Prediction Project
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the online food delivery industry has experienced exponential growth, driven by consumer demand for convenience and the rise of digital platforms. The efficiency and speed of food delivery are critical factors influencing customer satisfaction and the overall success of food delivery businesses.

For that, we are going to build a food delivery time prediction model. However, of course the timeliness required in delivering food to the customer's place is the main challenge in this service. Accuracy time in delivering the food must be shown to keep transparency with their customers. So, by using historical data on the time it takes to deliver food, the use of machine learning algorithms is one way to predict the accuracy of the time needed to deliver food to location.
